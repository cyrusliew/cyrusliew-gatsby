My time at 1Centre Limited as a Full Stack Developer allowed me to translate design concepts into practical, user-friendly features. I excelled in maintaining and optimizing legacy React functions, implementing stakeholder-driven features, and resolving critical bugs. My standout achievements include pioneering an anti-fraud feature, successfully migrating React code to TypeScript, and overhauling the public website CMS to improve performance by 30%. I also championed the adoption of Figma for design, enhancing productivity and collaboration.
