My tenure at Communica Limited started as a Front End Developer, focusing on crafting user-friendly interfaces, handling multiple projects, and optimizing website performance. Recognized for my skills and commitment, I was subsequently promoted to Lead Front End Developer. In this role, I led the Front End department, mentored junior developers, and oversaw project timelines and budgets. Notable achievements include implementing a code linter, building a React web portal, and enhancing the user experience by integrating a React app into Drupal. My work consistently delivered tailored solutions to companies of all sizes.
