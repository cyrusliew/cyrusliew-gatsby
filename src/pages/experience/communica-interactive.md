I started at Communica Limited as a Front End Developer, then advanced to Lead Front End Developer. I managed projects, mentored juniors, and achieved notable milestones like implementing a code linter, creating a React web portal, and enhancing user experience by integrating React with Drupal, delivering tailored solutions consistently.
