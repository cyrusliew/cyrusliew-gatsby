AdvisoryApps, determined to attain a higher ranking in Google search results, returned to collaborate with me. Understanding the importance of site speed, I proposed a comprehensive solutionâ€”rebuilding and migrating their website using Gatsby.js for the frontend and Strapi for the backend.

The results were nothing short of remarkable. With our new approach, we achieved a substantial jump in mobile performance, elevating their Google Page Speed Index score from 40 to a remarkable 82. This significant leap not only enhanced their search engine visibility but also improved user experience.

This project stands as a testament to the power of strategic web development and optimization, and it showcases how my expertise can drive transformative results for your digital endeavors.
