Orchid Systems was a delightful project that provided me with an opportunity to dive deep into enhancing my expertise with the Gutenberg Editor. It set a high standard for both block creation and theming, pushing the boundaries of creativity.

Additionally, as a senior developer, I took on the role of mentoring a junior developer, ensuring the quality of our code remained top-notch. We implemented multiple linters to maintain code quality standards and ensure they passed with flying colors.

**Features**

* Robust Drupal Gutenberg Editor implementation
* Custom Gutenberg blocks
* Drastic improvement in search and site directory
* Improved access control of downloadable items

**Role & Key Responsibilities**

* Monitor the progress on front end deliveries
* Monitor the quality of code produced
* Mentor and assist on Front End development
* Building and create Gutenberg custom blocks
