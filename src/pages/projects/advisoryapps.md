AdvisoryApps is one of the digital companies that offer a variety of digital solutions, which includes Web/ App development, fully customised system, game development, etc. I was in charge of building their brand new revamped website entirely in WordPress, from the front and back end. It was a great opportunity to adopt and implement one of the powerful drag and drop editor WordPress has released that time - the <a href="https://wordpress.org/gutenberg/" target="_blank">Gutenberg Editor</a>.

**Key features**

* Early adoption of WordPress Gutenberg Editor
* Custom React components 
* Making calls to WordPress built-in REST API

**Role and Key responsibilities**

* Full site build from front to back
