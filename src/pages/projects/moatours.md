MoaTours, your gateway to captivating New Zealand small group tours, underwent a digital transformation that reshaped the way travelers explore the scenic landscapes of this beautiful destination. 

As the driving force behind this project, I embarked on a mission to reimagine MoaTours' frontend using the power of React. Through GraphQL queries, we seamlessly retrieved and displayed data, making the user experience more engaging and efficient.

The impact was profound; not only did this renovation breathe new life into the website's design, but it also significantly boosted page speed, ensuring that visitors could access information faster and more seamlessly than ever before. Explore MoaTours and witness firsthand how this project enhanced the digital journey for travelers seeking the best of New Zealand.
